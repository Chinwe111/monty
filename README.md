Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO
This repository provides implementations of the Stack (LIFO) and Queue (FIFO) data structures in C - programming language.
Stacks and queues are fundamental data structures used to organize and manipulate collections of elements.

Stack (LIFO - Last In, First Out)
A stack is an ordered collection of elements where the addition and removal of elements follow the LIFO principle.
The last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. Think of it as a stack of plates where 
you can only add or remove plates from the top.

Features
Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
Pop: Removes the top element from the stack.
Peek/Top: Returns the value of the top element without removing it.
IsEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty.
Size: Returns the number of elements in the stack.

Queue (FIFO - First In, First Out)
A queue is an ordered collection of elements where the addition of new elements is done at one end (rear/tail) 
and the removal of elements is done at the other end (front/head). The elements follow the FIFO principle,
meaning the first element added will be the first one to be removed.

Features
Enqueue: Adds an element to the rear of the queue.
Dequeue: Removes the element from the front of the queue.
Front/Peek: Returns the value of the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
IsEmpty: Checks if the queue is empty.
Size: Returns the number of elements in the queue.
